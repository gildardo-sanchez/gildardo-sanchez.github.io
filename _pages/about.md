Gildardo completed his Ph.D. and M.Sc. in Computer Science from [Tecnologico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/es) (2001 and 1994). Before that, he got a B.Sc. in Chemical Engineering from [Universidad de Guadalajara (1990)]{https://www.udg.mx}.


Gildardo was an assistant researcher at the Wood, Cellulose and Paper Institute, of the Universidad de Guadalajara (1991-1992), Research Visitor at the [Robotics Lab]{https://ai.stanford.edu} from Stanford University (1999-2001). During 2004-2005 he was a Research Fellow at the [National University of Singapore]{https://www.nus.edu.sg} thru the [Singapore-MIT Alliance]{https://smart.mit.edu}. From 2016-2021 he was appointed as Rector of the [Universidad Politécnica de Yucatán]{https://www.upy.edu.mx}.


His interests in research are focused on Motion Planning Algorithms for robots, and more recently on the application of Machine Learning techniques to solve complex problems in different domains.


He is a National Researcher, Level I by the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores in Mexico.

Currently Gildardo is a full time Professor of the Computer Science Department of Tecnologico de Monterrey, Campus Guadalajara.
