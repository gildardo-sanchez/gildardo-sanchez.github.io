During the semester August-December 2022, I was teaching the following courses:

## TC2038 Analysis and Design of Algorithms
======
*Objectives:*
1. Implement computational algorithms that solve problems.
2. Optimizes computational algorithms that are applied in the development of solutions.
3. Applies the principles of sustainability in the solution of computational problems and information technologies that guarantee the well-being of future generations.


## TC3006C and TC3007C Concentration on Advanced Artificial Intelligence for Data Science
======

1. Uses artificial intelligence and cognitive computing methods to solve optimization problems.
2. Build deterministic or stochastic mathematical models, supported by state-of-the-art computational tools.
3. Implements projects aimed at transforming the environment and common well-being, with ethical awareness and social responsibility.

## TC3054 Business Solution Development Capstone Project
======
*Objectives:* This is an advanced level course in the area of computing, designed to develop students' creative skills, based on a formal research method. This process will allow students to integrate their knowledge in the development of viable, new technology-based products. Previous knowledge is required in the fundamentals of Software Engineering and Computer Science. The learning outcome for this course is that students be able to identify the problems or needs of individuals and organizations and develop ICT projects to meet those needs, in a context of applied research that integrates the knowledge obtained during their careers.
